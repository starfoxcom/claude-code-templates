"""The review gate's logic, shared by the routine and deep review workflows so
the workflow files stay the same for every project. Standard library and the
runner's `gh`, Python 3.8+. The workflows run the copy from the base branch.

    review_gate.py triage FILES [--incomplete]      -> {"review": true|false}
    review_gate.py verdict --since TS (--tier routine --marker RE | --tier deep)
        -> {"verdict": "pass"|"block"|"missing", "line": ...[, "recovered": ...]}
        (reads the PR's comments as `gh api --paginate` prints them, on stdin)
    review_gate.py gate --state STATE [--triage T] [--routine R] [--escalated] [--deep D] [--order O]
        -> {"status", "conclusion", "title", "summary", "state"} for the "Review gate" check
    review_gate.py upsert --repo OWNER/NAME --sha HEAD [facts as for gate] [--note TEXT]
        -> the same, after creating or updating the check on that commit (GH_TOKEN
           needs checks: write); --note is appended to the check's summary, and
           --order is required with --triage, --routine or --deep
    review_gate.py settings [--file .github/review-gate.yml] -> KEY=value lines

The "Review gate" check carries its own state in its external_id, e.g.
"triage=reviewable;routine=pass;escalated=yes;deep=none;routine_by=0.0.0;deep_by=0.0.0"
(an empty one is the start state). Each review workflow reads it, sets the
facts it knows and writes back the result, so whichever finishes last has
every fact. T: reviewable|skip; R: pending|pass|block|missing|error;
D: none|pass|block|missing|error. --escalated only ever turns on: once a deep
review was asked for, it stays asked. A workflow that cannot tell a fact
leaves its option out, keeping the stored value.

The two workflows can write at the same moment, and a write carries the whole
state as its writer read it, so one can wipe the other's facts. Two rules make
that harmless:
  - Each tier's facts carry the --order of the step that wrote them,
    RUN.ATTEMPT.STEP (routine_by for triage and routine, deep_by for deep),
    compared as numbers, field by field. RUN is whatever makes the run that
    counts the newest within its tier: the routine workflow uses its run id,
    and the deep workflow uses the moment its review job started, in
    nanoseconds, since its newest run cancels the one in flight. The two tiers'
    stamps are never compared with each other. A write from an older run never
    replaces a newer run's facts, so a cancelled deep run cannot undo the run
    that replaced it.
  - After writing, upsert reads the check back twice, a few seconds apart, and
    writes again when its own facts are gone.

Every command prints one line; a bad argument prints {"error": ...} and exits 1.
