"""PreToolUse hook: block force pushes that permission rules cannot see.

Permission rules match command text, so `-f` bundled with other short flags
(`-qf`, `-vf`, `-uqf`) escapes them. This hook reads the text of every Bash
and PowerShell command and blocks a git push that carries:

- `--force` or `-f`, alone or inside a short-flag bundle;
- `--mirror` (or a prefix of it), which force-updates and deletes every
  remote ref;
- a refspec starting with `+`, a force push of that one ref;
- `-c remote.<name>.push=+...` or a true `-c remote.<name>.mirror`;
- a one-off alias for push (`git -c alias.p='push -f' p`).

`--force-with-lease` and `--force-if-includes` stay allowed: they refuse to
overwrite work the local repo has not seen. The same checks cover git's push
plumbing, `send-pack` and `http-push`, and the dashed `git-push` programs.

It is a safety net for force pushes written the ordinary way, not a sandbox
against a command built to slip past it: no text check can be one, since a
program started by the command can push on its own.

The hook reads text, not shell grammar. First it removes what the shell
would remove: line continuations, quotes, backslashes and backticks,
decoding Bash's `$'...'` escapes (the result stays one word) and
PowerShell's `` `u{...} `` on the way. Each command substitution (`$(...)`,
`$((...))`, `${...}`, `<(...)`, a Bash backtick pair, a PowerShell `(...)`)
is read on its own. In the text around it, a substitution inside a word
joins the text on both sides (`-q$(true)f` reads as `-qf`) and one at a
word's edge leaves a word; a PowerShell group of quoted literals
(`@('push','-qf')`) stays in place as arguments. The rest is cut into
statements at every newline, and at every `;`, `|` and `&` that is neither
escaped nor inside a quoted string that closes on its own line (in
PowerShell also at `{` and `}`). Redirects and their targets are dropped,
except a target that names git (`bash <<< "git push -f"`). After a `git`
word, a later push word in the same statement starts the push, and the
words after it are its arguments. Text inside `eval`, `sh -c`,
`pwsh -Command`, a heredoc or a comment is read the same way. Every step is
linear in the command's length.

That includes text that only mentions a force push: a commit message, a
script or a search pattern with `git push -f` in it is blocked too. The
block message says to put such text in a file and pass the file instead.

The hook only ever blocks or stays silent; it never asks. Out of reach, so
these run without a block:

- a force flag the shell builds at run time (`git push $FLAGS`,
  `$(echo -qf)`, `xargs`, brace expansion, text piped into a shell or
  `iex`, `('-q'+'f')`, PowerShell's `--%`);
- git config or aliases that force a later plain `git push`, whether on
  disk (`git config alias.p 'push -f'`, a `remote.<name>.push` or `mirror`
  setting) or set in the same command (`GIT_CONFIG_*` variables,
  `--config-env`);
- git reached by another name: a variable (`G=git; $G push -f`; `$GIT` and
  `${GIT:-git}` are read as git), a shell alias or `Set-Alias`, `hash -p`,
  or a glob (`gi[t]`);
- remote branch and tag deletions, and a branch deleted and then pushed
  again;
- a push run by another program (`python -c`, `node -e`, `make`, `gh api`,
  `git fetch --upload-pack`);
- a push after a git option value with spaces in it, one of whose later
  words is exactly a git subcommand in OTHER_SUBCOMMANDS (`git -C "My notes
  dir" push -f`): the search for the push word stops there;
- shell syntax this reading takes differently from the shell, where that
  cuts a push off from its `git` word or its force flag: quotes paired
  differently (a quoted string that spans lines, a `$(`, `${` or backtick
  inside single quotes, as in `echo '$('; git push origin main ')' -f`), or
  parentheses left unbalanced inside a substitution;
- a command over MAX_COMMAND characters.

Project deny rules cover some of these by text (`git remote *--mi*`, `gh repo
sync *--force*`). Input that is not JSON and any error while reading a
command let the call through, the same as a hook that timed out.

Setup installs this file as `~/.claude/hooks/push-guard.py` and registers it
in `~/.claude/settings.json`, never in a project's settings: some tools copy
the launcher of existing project hooks into their own hook entries. Setup
registers it only after finding a Python 3.8+ interpreter outside any virtual
environment, naming both the interpreter and this file by absolute path, in
exec form (`command` plus `args`), so no shell and no `python3`/`python`/`py`
guess is involved. It runs through a `runpy` one-liner instead of
`python <path>` because Python exits 2 when it cannot open a script, which
would block every call; through `runpy` a missing file is an ordinary error
and the call proceeds. The interpreter runs with `-I`, so the project
directory (the hook's working directory) is not on the import path and a
repo's own `json.py` cannot replace the modules this file imports.
