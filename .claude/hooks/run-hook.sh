# Starts one of this repo's guard hooks: sh run-hook.sh <name>
# Claude Code pipes the tool call to stdin as JSON; the hook reads it there.
#
# The hook is skipped, and the tool call goes ahead, when:
# - ~/.claude/hooks/<name>.py exists and ~/.claude/settings.json names it
#   outside a permission rule, so the user's own copy runs and the check
#   never runs twice (a registration whose file is gone does not count);
# - no Python 3.8+ outside a virtual environment is on PATH.
#
# A committed file cannot name the interpreter by absolute path, so this
# looks for one. A virtual environment's interpreter is refused because it
# can belong to the project. Python runs with -I, so the project's own
# modules cannot replace the ones the hook imports, and through runpy, so a
# missing hook file is an ordinary error (the call goes ahead) instead of
# Python's exit 2, which would block every call.

# the safe side.
